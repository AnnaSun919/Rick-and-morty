## MVP

As a Rick and Morty follower I want to:

- list characters from the API with basic infos: name, species, status, image and created date displayed.
- see the first 10 characters, with the ability to paginate (10 characters per page).
- filter the characters by species and/or status.
- filter the characters created between two different dates.
- once I choose a character show additional informations: gender, origin and episodes infos in which this character appeared.

## Goal
